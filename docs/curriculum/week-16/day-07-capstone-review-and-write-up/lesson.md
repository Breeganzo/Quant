## Why It Matters In Quant
Capstone review and write-up is part of real quant work inside signals ii: factor models, statistical arbitrage intuition, cointegration, and regime shifts research, trading, or risk workflows.

## Concept Build (Intuition -> Technical -> Market Use)
1. Intuition: Performance after implementation frictions.
2. Technical frame: Build capstone review and write-up from intuition to implementation: define the core mechanism, map it to measurable outputs, and state one assumption that can break in live deployment. (key formulas/workflows: Net Return, Out-of-Sample RMSE, Max Drawdown).
3. Market interpretation: Final report realism.. Run one compact, reproducible example for capstone review and write-up and explain both the signal and the main failure mode a quant team should watch.
4. Failure mode check: Presenting gross-only metrics.

## Real-World Solved Case (Step-by-Step)
- Step 1 (Problem framing): Define the desk decision and why capstone review and write-up is relevant.
- Step 2 (Data and assumptions): Use `curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv`, state one data-quality assumption and one regime-risk assumption.
- Step 3 (Method): Apply Net Return or a directly related workflow on a reproducible sample.
- Step 4 (Result): Report one quantitative output and one practical interpretation for research, trading, or risk.
- Step 5 (Caveat): Document one failure mode: Presenting gross-only metrics.
- Step 6 (Robustness): Re-run with one alternate window, parameter, or benchmark and compare conclusions.

## Deep Study Prompts (10-Hour Track)
- What assumption is easiest to violate in live markets and how would you detect that early?
- Which output would you show a PM or risk manager first, and why?
- Which alternate explanation could produce similar numbers but imply a different action?
- What metric could improve while hidden risk still worsens?

## Practice Problems
- Explain capstone review and write-up in one paragraph without jargon.
- Write down one topic-specific formula or workflow for capstone review and write-up from memory.
- Connect capstone review and write-up to one realistic trading, portfolio, risk, or research decision.

## 10-Hour Deliverables
- Produce 2-3 pages of notes with intuition, formal definitions, formulas, and one solved real-world case.
- Complete all notebook labs plus one extension experiment with changed assumptions or parameters.
- Add at least two error-log entries with specific correction rules and review dates.
- Record a 2-minute spoken explanation and a 1-minute risk caveat explanation for interview practice.
- Write a short desk memo: decision, evidence, risk caveat, and next test.

## Daily Quiz (Closed-Book)
1. What is the core intuition behind capstone review and write-up?
2. Write one formula or workflow from memory and define each term.
3. Give one practical quant use case and one failure mode.

## Interview-Ready Formula Sheet
### Formula 1: Net Return
$$r_t^{net}=r_t^{gross}-cost_t$$
Plain-English interpretation: Performance after implementation frictions.
Interview pitfall: Presenting gross-only metrics.

### Formula 2: Out-of-Sample RMSE
$$RMSE_{OOS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(\hat y_i-y_i)^2}$$
Plain-English interpretation: Forecast quality on unseen data.
Interview pitfall: Leaking test data into tuning.

### Formula 3: Max Drawdown
$$MDD=\min_t\left(\frac{W_t}{\max_{s\le t}W_s}-1\right)$$
Plain-English interpretation: Worst path-dependent loss.
Interview pitfall: Reporting return with no drawdown context.

## Formula Organization Table
| Formula/Workflow | Meaning | Finance Use Case | Common Misread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Net Return | Performance after implementation frictions. | Final report realism. | Presenting gross-only metrics. |
| Out-of-Sample RMSE | Forecast quality on unseen data. | Capstone model comparison. | Leaking test data into tuning. |
| Max Drawdown | Worst path-dependent loss. | Risk defense in presentations. | Reporting return with no drawdown context. |

## Common Mistakes and Fixes
- Mistake: copying formulas without defining each symbol. Fix: annotate each term in plain language.
- Mistake: reporting one number without context. Fix: compare to benchmark or alternate scenario.
- Mistake: reading model output as certainty. Fix: include one failure mode and one robustness check.
- Mistake: skipping assumptions. Fix: list assumptions before interpretation.

## Revision Sprint
- Re-solve one earlier problem from memory before checking notes.
- Review yesterday's weak point and state whether it is fixed.
- Schedule the next spaced repetition date before ending the session.

## Real-World Data Lab
- Use yfinance first for SPY, QQQ, TLT, and GLD when internet is available.
- If available, validate against a Robinhood-style export CSV for consistency checks.
- Fall back to curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv for reproducible runs.
- Design one topic-specific analysis for capstone review and write-up instead of reusing generic volatility-only metrics.
- Document one implementation risk and one robustness check before finalizing conclusions.

## Coding Task
Estimate spread/z-score style metrics for capstone review and write-up and define one disciplined entry/exit rule.
- Add comments that explain the intent of each major transformation and why it matters for quant decisions.
- Print one table and one metric summary that could be shown in a desk review.
- Add one stress or sensitivity variation and compare baseline versus stressed output.
- End with a one-paragraph interpretation describing actionability and limitations.

## Interview Drill
- Q1: Explain capstone review and write-up to a non-technical stakeholder in 3 sentences.
- Q2: Give one failure case where this concept can produce misleading confidence.
- Q3: Show one concrete link from this concept to trading, portfolio construction, risk, or research quality.

## Reflection Prompt
What from capstone review and write-up is now evidence-backed in your notes, and what still needs a focused retry?

## Completion Checklist
- I can explain the concept from memory without reading notes.
- I completed at least one coding exercise tied to the day topic.
- I wrote one realistic use case in my own words.
- I recorded at least one weak area in my error log.
- I set the next review date using spaced repetition.

## Sunday Mini-Project Blueprint
1. Load real market data from `curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv`.
2. Define a clear project question and one measurable output metric.
3. Build at least one baseline and one variation, then compare outcomes.
4. Write a short conclusion with one limitation and one next-step improvement.
