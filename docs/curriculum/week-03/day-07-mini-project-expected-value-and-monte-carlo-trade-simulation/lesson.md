## Why It Matters In Quant
Mini project: expected value and Monte Carlo trade simulation is part of real quant work inside math rebuild i: algebra, calculus intuition, probability rules, apis, and monte carlo thinking research, trading, or risk workflows.

## Learning Overview
The Week 3 project ties math to uncertainty. A Monte Carlo notebook is one of the cleanest beginner ways to see how probability, expected value, and sampling variation interact.

## Continuity
- Start by recalling what from yesterday is still unclear.
- Use today's topic to fix at least one weak area from your error log.
- End by writing a one-paragraph bridge to tomorrow's topic.

## Core Concepts
### Monte Carlo intuition
- Simple explanation: Monte Carlo means simulating many possible outcomes to understand a distribution.
- Technical depth: Even when analytic answers exist, simulation helps build intuition for variability, tail risk, and the gap between expected and realized outcomes.
- Finance example: Repeatedly simulating a trading payoff shows why a positive edge still produces streaks of losses.

## Worked Examples
- Simulate 1000 paths of a simple discrete trading payoff.
- Compare the simulated sample mean with the theoretical expected value.

## Practice Questions With Answers
### Question: Why is Monte Carlo useful for beginners in quant finance?
Answer: Because it makes uncertainty concrete and shows the distribution of possible outcomes instead of only one formula.

## Daily Quiz (Closed-Book)
1. Explain today's core intuition from memory.
2. Write one formula/workflow and define all symbols/steps.
3. Give one use case and one realistic failure mode.

## Interview-Ready Formula Sheet
### Formula 1: Expected Value
$$\mathbb{E}[X]=\sum_i p_i x_i$$
Plain-English interpretation: Probability-weighted average payoff.
Notation check: Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails.

### Formula 2: Variance
$$\mathrm{Var}(X)=\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2]$$
Plain-English interpretation: Spread around expected payoff.
Notation check: Using only mean without uncertainty.

### Formula 3: Kelly Fraction (Binary)
$$f^*=\frac{bp-q}{b}$$
Plain-English interpretation: Theoretical growth-optimal bet size.
Notation check: Applying full Kelly under estimation error.

## Formula Organization Table
| Formula/Workflow | Meaning | Finance Use Case | Common Misread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected Value | Probability-weighted average payoff. | Filter positive-edge trading setups. | Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails. |
| Variance | Spread around expected payoff. | Risk-adjusted strategy comparison. | Using only mean without uncertainty. |
| Kelly Fraction (Binary) | Theoretical growth-optimal bet size. | Position-sizing intuition. | Applying full Kelly under estimation error. |

## Extended Study (to complete a full 10-hour day)
1. Rewrite each core concept in your own words without looking at notes.
2. Add one extra solved case using different assumptions and compare outputs.
3. Explain one failure mode where this concept can be misapplied in trading or risk work.
4. Add one short paragraph linking this concept to your weekly project objective.
5. Propose one follow-up experiment for tomorrow and define success/failure criteria.

## Real-World Data Application
1. Use `curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv` as reproducible fallback market panel.
2. Run one baseline analysis and one stressed-assumption variant.
3. Document one risk caveat and one robustness check before finalizing conclusions.

- Use yfinance first for SPY, QQQ, TLT, and GLD when internet is available.
- If available, validate against a Robinhood-style export CSV for consistency checks.
- Fall back to curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv for reproducible runs.
- Design one topic-specific analysis for mini project: expected value and monte carlo trade simulation instead of reusing generic volatility-only metrics.
- Document one implementation risk and one robustness check before finalizing conclusions.

## Coding Task
Implement a small reproducible example for mini project: expected value and monte carlo trade simulation and explain one assumption that could fail in markets.

## Daily Interview Drill
### Q: What does a Monte Carlo simulation help you see that a single expected value does not?
A: It shows dispersion, tail outcomes, streaks, and the range of realistic sample paths.

## Reflection Question
What from mini project: expected value and monte carlo trade simulation is now evidence-backed in your notes, and what still needs a focused retry?

## Completion Checklist
- I completed the planned study blocks or adjusted them honestly.
- I rewrote the main ideas from memory.
- I finished the notebook cells and checked the outputs.
- I logged at least one weak spot in the error log.
- I practiced at least one interview answer aloud.
