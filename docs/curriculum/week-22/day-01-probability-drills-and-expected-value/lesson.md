## Why It Matters In Quant
Probability drills and expected value is part of real quant work inside interview prep i: probability, statistics, mental math, python, sql, and markets discussion research, trading, or risk workflows.

## Concept Build (Intuition -> Technical -> Market Use)
1. Intuition: Probability-weighted average payoff.
2. Technical frame: Build probability drills and expected value from intuition to implementation: define the core mechanism, map it to measurable outputs, and state one assumption that can break in live deployment. (key formulas/workflows: Expected Value, Variance, Kelly Fraction (Binary)).
3. Market interpretation: Filter positive-edge trading setups.. Run one compact, reproducible example for probability drills and expected value and explain both the signal and the main failure mode a quant team should watch.
4. Failure mode check: Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails.

## Real-World Solved Case (Step-by-Step)
- Step 1 (Problem framing): Define the desk decision and why probability drills and expected value is relevant.
- Step 2 (Data and assumptions): Use `curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv`, state one data-quality assumption and one regime-risk assumption.
- Step 3 (Method): Apply Expected Value or a directly related workflow on a reproducible sample.
- Step 4 (Result): Report one quantitative output and one practical interpretation for research, trading, or risk.
- Step 5 (Caveat): Document one failure mode: Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails.
- Step 6 (Robustness): Re-run with one alternate window, parameter, or benchmark and compare conclusions.

## Deep Study Prompts (10-Hour Track)
- What assumption is easiest to violate in live markets and how would you detect that early?
- Which output would you show a PM or risk manager first, and why?
- Which alternate explanation could produce similar numbers but imply a different action?
- What metric could improve while hidden risk still worsens?

## Practice Problems
- Explain probability drills and expected value in one paragraph without jargon.
- Write down one topic-specific formula or workflow for probability drills and expected value from memory.
- Connect probability drills and expected value to one realistic trading, portfolio, risk, or research decision.

## 10-Hour Deliverables
- Produce 2-3 pages of notes with intuition, formal definitions, formulas, and one solved real-world case.
- Complete all notebook labs plus one extension experiment with changed assumptions or parameters.
- Add at least two error-log entries with specific correction rules and review dates.
- Record a 2-minute spoken explanation and a 1-minute risk caveat explanation for interview practice.
- Write a short desk memo: decision, evidence, risk caveat, and next test.

## Daily Quiz (Closed-Book)
1. What is the core intuition behind probability drills and expected value?
2. Write one formula or workflow from memory and define each term.
3. Give one practical quant use case and one failure mode.

## Interview-Ready Formula Sheet
### Formula 1: Expected Value
$$\mathbb{E}[X]=\sum_i p_i x_i$$
Plain-English interpretation: Probability-weighted average payoff.
Interview pitfall: Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails.

### Formula 2: Variance
$$\mathrm{Var}(X)=\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^2]$$
Plain-English interpretation: Spread around expected payoff.
Interview pitfall: Using only mean without uncertainty.

### Formula 3: Kelly Fraction (Binary)
$$f^*=\frac{bp-q}{b}$$
Plain-English interpretation: Theoretical growth-optimal bet size.
Interview pitfall: Applying full Kelly under estimation error.

## Formula Organization Table
| Formula/Workflow | Meaning | Finance Use Case | Common Misread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected Value | Probability-weighted average payoff. | Filter positive-edge trading setups. | Ignoring payoff asymmetry and tails. |
| Variance | Spread around expected payoff. | Risk-adjusted strategy comparison. | Using only mean without uncertainty. |
| Kelly Fraction (Binary) | Theoretical growth-optimal bet size. | Position-sizing intuition. | Applying full Kelly under estimation error. |

## Common Mistakes and Fixes
- Mistake: copying formulas without defining each symbol. Fix: annotate each term in plain language.
- Mistake: reporting one number without context. Fix: compare to benchmark or alternate scenario.
- Mistake: reading model output as certainty. Fix: include one failure mode and one robustness check.
- Mistake: skipping assumptions. Fix: list assumptions before interpretation.

## Revision Sprint
- Re-solve one earlier problem from memory before checking notes.
- Review yesterday's weak point and state whether it is fixed.
- Schedule the next spaced repetition date before ending the session.

## Real-World Data Lab
- Run one timed drill and record completion time and accuracy.
- Write a two-minute spoken answer script with one equation and one risk caveat.
- Log one weakness that appeared under time pressure and schedule a targeted retry.

## Coding Task
Solve one timed coding/math drill for probability drills and expected value and write a concise interview-quality explanation.
- Add comments that explain the intent of each major transformation and why it matters for quant decisions.
- Print one table and one metric summary that could be shown in a desk review.
- Add one stress or sensitivity variation and compare baseline versus stressed output.
- End with a one-paragraph interpretation describing actionability and limitations.

## Interview Drill
- Q1: Explain probability drills and expected value to a non-technical stakeholder in 3 sentences.
- Q2: Give one failure case where this concept can produce misleading confidence.
- Q3: Show one concrete link from this concept to trading, portfolio construction, risk, or research quality.

## Reflection Prompt
What from probability drills and expected value is now evidence-backed in your notes, and what still needs a focused retry?

## Completion Checklist
- I can explain the concept from memory without reading notes.
- I completed at least one coding exercise tied to the day topic.
- I wrote one realistic use case in my own words.
- I recorded at least one weak area in my error log.
- I set the next review date using spaced repetition.
