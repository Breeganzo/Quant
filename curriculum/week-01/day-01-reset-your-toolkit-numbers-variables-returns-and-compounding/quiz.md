# Week 01 Day 01 Quiz: Reset your toolkit: numbers, variables, returns, and compounding

## Instructions
- Attempt closed-book first.
- After answering, compare with the answer key and write one correction note.
- Treat each question as a short trading interview prompt.
- For each item, complete the Python drill using real data and interpret the output.
- Use a structured answer style: direct answer, evidence, caveat, and follow-up check.
- Target score: at least 4/5 confidence on every item before moving on.

## Trading Interview Questions, Answers, and Python Drills
### Q1 (basic)
Interview question: Explain reset your toolkit: numbers, variables, returns, and compounding in plain language for a trading or risk audience.

Model answer: A strong answer defines reset your toolkit: numbers, variables, returns, and compounding, gives one concrete workflow or market-facing decision example, and states one practical limitation that must be monitored.
How to answer in a live interview: Definition -> practical use case -> limitation/risk check.
Why this matters: This tests communication quality, not just memorized definitions.

### Q2 (intermediate)
Interview question: Write the Simple Return formula/workflow from memory and define each symbol.

Model answer: A strong answer includes Simple Return exactly, explains each symbol, and states one caveat: Comparing assets without handling frequency or missing days.
How to answer in a live interview: State formula -> define symbols -> add caveat and context.
Why this matters: This checks mathematical fluency and operational reliability.

Python drill: Compute log returns and summarize annualized return/risk with one caveat.
Suggested Python solution:
```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

market = pd.read_csv(Path("curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv"), parse_dates=["date"])
prices = market.pivot(index="date", columns="symbol", values="close").dropna()
ret = prices.pct_change().dropna()
ann_ret = ret.mean() * 252
ann_vol = ret.std() * (252 ** 0.5)
print(pd.DataFrame({"ann_return": ann_ret, "ann_vol": ann_vol}).round(4))

```

### Q3 (intermediate)
Interview question: Give one realistic use case, one implementation choice, and one failure mode if this concept is misapplied.

Model answer: A strong answer uses one decision workflow such as: Baseline daily performance attribution.. Then it states one realistic failure mode: Comparing assets without handling frequency or missing days., one detection check, and one mitigation action.
How to answer in a live interview: Use case -> implementation choice -> failure mode -> mitigation.
Why this matters: This evaluates transfer from theory to practical quant workflow.

### Q4 (advanced)
Interview question: How would you validate data quality and implementation assumptions before trusting conclusions in production?

Model answer: Check schema consistency, missing values, temporal alignment, leakage risks, and sensitivity to stress windows. Then compare one metric across alternate assumptions or data sources, and set a threshold that triggers a review.
How to answer in a live interview: Validation checklist -> stress check -> escalation threshold.
Why this matters: This tests robustness discipline and implementation realism.

### Q5 (advanced)
Interview question: A PM asks for a decision in 30 seconds. What metric would you lead with and what caveat would you immediately include?

Model answer: Lead with one actionable metric tied to objective (for example risk-adjusted return, hit rate under costs, or drawdown stability), then immediately state one caveat on sample dependence, costs, regime shift, or data quality.
How to answer in a live interview: Primary metric -> direct recommendation -> caveat.
Why this matters: This tests concise decision communication under time pressure.

### Q6 (advanced)
Interview question: What is one follow-up experiment you would run tomorrow to reduce uncertainty in today's conclusion?

Model answer: Propose one focused experiment (alternate window, benchmark, transaction-cost assumption, or feature variation), state expected impact, and define what result would change your recommendation.
How to answer in a live interview: Experiment design -> expected effect -> decision boundary.
Why this matters: This tests scientific thinking and iterative research discipline.

## Reflection
- Which item was weakest and why?
- What would you improve before saying this answer in a live interview?
- What will you review before tomorrow?
- What evidence shows your answer quality improved versus last week?
- If a PM challenged your conclusion, what single additional test would you run first?
