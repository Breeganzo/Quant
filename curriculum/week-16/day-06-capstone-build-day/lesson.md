# Week 16 Sat: Capstone build day

**Estimated time:** 6 hours

## Daily Mission
This day belongs to the week theme "Signals II: factor models, statistical arbitrage intuition, cointegration, and regime shifts". Your objective is to understand, apply, and communicate capstone build day in a way a quant team would trust.

## Continuity Map
- Previous day focus: Cross-sectional portfolio construction
- Today's focus: Capstone build day
- Next day bridge: Capstone review and write-up

## Session Plan
| Session | Duration | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session 1 | 60 min | Closed-book recall and formula rewrite. |
| Session 2 | 60 min | High-value concept reinforcement with worked examples. |
| Session 3 | 60 min | Notebook review and focused extension task. |
| Session 4 | 60 min | Weekly mini-project or capstone build increment. |
| Session 5 | 60 min | Interview rehearsal and technical defense. |
| Session 6 | 60 min | Reflection, error-log cleanup, and next-step planning. |

## Why It Matters In Quant
Capstone build day is part of real quant work inside signals ii: factor models, statistical arbitrage intuition, cointegration, and regime shifts research, trading, or risk workflows.

## Concept Build (Intuition -> Technical -> Market Use)
1. Intuition: Performance after implementation frictions.
2. Technical frame: Build capstone build day from intuition to implementation: define the core mechanism, map it to measurable outputs, and state one assumption that can break in live deployment. (key formulas/workflows: Net Return, Out-of-Sample RMSE, Max Drawdown).
3. Market interpretation: Final report realism.. Run one compact, reproducible example for capstone build day and explain both the signal and the main failure mode a quant team should watch.
4. Failure mode check: Presenting gross-only metrics.

## Practice Problems
- Explain capstone build day in one paragraph without jargon.
- Write down one topic-specific formula or workflow for capstone build day from memory.
- Connect capstone build day to one realistic trading, portfolio, risk, or research decision.

## 6-Hour Deliverables
- Produce one page of notes with intuition, formulas, and one market example in your own words.
- Complete all notebook cells and annotate each output with what it means financially.
- Add one error-log entry with a scheduled review date.
- Record a 60-90 second spoken explanation of the concept as interview practice.

## Daily Quiz (Closed-Book)
1. What is the core intuition behind capstone build day?
2. Write one formula or workflow from memory and define each term.
3. Give one practical quant use case and one failure mode.

## Interview-Ready Formula Sheet
### Formula 1: Net Return
$$r_t^{net}=r_t^{gross}-cost_t$$
Plain-English interpretation: Performance after implementation frictions.
Interview pitfall: Presenting gross-only metrics.

### Formula 2: Out-of-Sample RMSE
$$RMSE_{OOS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(\hat y_i-y_i)^2}$$
Plain-English interpretation: Forecast quality on unseen data.
Interview pitfall: Leaking test data into tuning.

### Formula 3: Max Drawdown
$$MDD=\min_t\left(\frac{W_t}{\max_{s\le t}W_s}-1\right)$$
Plain-English interpretation: Worst path-dependent loss.
Interview pitfall: Reporting return with no drawdown context.

## Formula Organization Table
| Formula/Workflow | Meaning | Finance Use Case | Common Misread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Net Return | Performance after implementation frictions. | Final report realism. | Presenting gross-only metrics. |
| Out-of-Sample RMSE | Forecast quality on unseen data. | Capstone model comparison. | Leaking test data into tuning. |
| Max Drawdown | Worst path-dependent loss. | Risk defense in presentations. | Reporting return with no drawdown context. |

## Common Mistakes and Fixes
- Mistake: copying formulas without defining each symbol. Fix: annotate each term in plain language.
- Mistake: reporting one number without context. Fix: compare to benchmark or alternate scenario.
- Mistake: reading model output as certainty. Fix: include one failure mode and one robustness check.
- Mistake: skipping assumptions. Fix: list assumptions before interpretation.

## Revision Sprint
- Re-solve one earlier problem from memory before checking notes.
- Review yesterday's weak point and state whether it is fixed.
- Schedule the next spaced repetition date before ending the session.

## Real-World Data Lab
- Use yfinance first for SPY, QQQ, TLT, and GLD when internet is available.
- If available, validate against a Robinhood-style export CSV for consistency checks.
- Fall back to curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv for reproducible runs.
- Design one topic-specific analysis for capstone build day instead of reusing generic volatility-only metrics.
- Document one implementation risk and one robustness check before finalizing conclusions.

## Coding Task
Estimate spread/z-score style metrics for capstone build day and define one disciplined entry/exit rule.

## Interview Drill
- Q1: Explain capstone build day to a non-technical stakeholder in 3 sentences.
- Q2: Give one failure case where this concept can produce misleading confidence.
- Q3: Show one concrete link from this concept to trading, portfolio construction, risk, or research quality.

## Reflection Prompt
What from capstone build day is now evidence-backed in your notes, and what still needs a focused retry?

## Completion Checklist
- I can explain the concept from memory without reading notes.
- I completed at least one coding exercise tied to the day topic.
- I wrote one realistic use case in my own words.
- I recorded at least one weak area in my error log.
- I set the next review date using spaced repetition.

## Saturday Revision Protocol
1. Rebuild your week summary from memory before opening notes.
2. Rework two weak problems from your error log with corrected reasoning.
3. Refresh formula sheet entries and mark confidence 0-5 per formula.
4. Prepare one interview-style explanation for the week's hardest concept.
