## Why It Matters In Quant
Autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure is part of real quant work inside time series i: stationarity, ar/ma/arima intuition, walk-forward testing, and forecasting research, trading, or risk workflows.

## Concept Build (Intuition -> Technical -> Market Use)
1. Intuition: Joint variation around means.
2. Technical frame: Build autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure from intuition to implementation: define the core mechanism, map it to measurable outputs, and state one assumption that can break in live deployment. (key formulas/workflows: Covariance, Correlation, 2-Asset Variance).
3. Market interpretation: Diversification diagnostics.. Run one compact, reproducible example for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure and explain both the signal and the main failure mode a quant team should watch.
4. Failure mode check: Miscaligned timestamps inflate noise.

## Real-World Solved Case (Step-by-Step)
- Step 1 (Problem framing): Define the desk decision and why autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure is relevant.
- Step 2 (Data and assumptions): Use `curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv`, state one data-quality assumption and one regime-risk assumption.
- Step 3 (Method): Apply Covariance or a directly related workflow on a reproducible sample.
- Step 4 (Result): Report one quantitative output and one practical interpretation for research, trading, or risk.
- Step 5 (Caveat): Document one failure mode: Miscaligned timestamps inflate noise.
- Step 6 (Robustness): Re-run with one alternate window, parameter, or benchmark and compare conclusions.

## Deep Study Prompts (10-Hour Track)
- What assumption is easiest to violate in live markets and how would you detect that early?
- Which output would you show a PM or risk manager first, and why?
- Which alternate explanation could produce similar numbers but imply a different action?
- What metric could improve while hidden risk still worsens?

## Practice Problems
- Explain autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure in one paragraph without jargon.
- Write down one topic-specific formula or workflow for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure from memory.
- Connect autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure to one realistic trading, portfolio, risk, or research decision.

## 10-Hour Deliverables
- Produce 2-3 pages of notes with intuition, formal definitions, formulas, and one solved real-world case.
- Complete all notebook labs plus one extension experiment with changed assumptions or parameters.
- Add at least two error-log entries with specific correction rules and review dates.
- Record a 2-minute spoken explanation and a 1-minute risk caveat explanation for interview practice.
- Write a short desk memo: decision, evidence, risk caveat, and next test.

## Daily Quiz (Closed-Book)
1. What is the core intuition behind autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure?
2. Write one formula or workflow from memory and define each term.
3. Give one practical quant use case and one failure mode.

## Interview-Ready Formula Sheet
### Formula 1: Covariance
$$\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_i(x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)$$
Plain-English interpretation: Joint variation around means.
Interview pitfall: Miscaligned timestamps inflate noise.

### Formula 2: Correlation
$$\rho_{XY}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$
Plain-English interpretation: Scale-free co-movement in [-1,1].
Interview pitfall: Confusing correlation with causation.

### Formula 3: 2-Asset Variance
$$\sigma_p^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2\rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2$$
Plain-English interpretation: Risk decomposition for two-asset mix.
Interview pitfall: Ignoring correlation regime shifts.

## Formula Organization Table
| Formula/Workflow | Meaning | Finance Use Case | Common Misread |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Covariance | Joint variation around means. | Diversification diagnostics. | Miscaligned timestamps inflate noise. |
| Correlation | Scale-free co-movement in [-1,1]. | Asset clustering and hedging checks. | Confusing correlation with causation. |
| 2-Asset Variance | Risk decomposition for two-asset mix. | Show diversification impact directly. | Ignoring correlation regime shifts. |

## Common Mistakes and Fixes
- Mistake: copying formulas without defining each symbol. Fix: annotate each term in plain language.
- Mistake: reporting one number without context. Fix: compare to benchmark or alternate scenario.
- Mistake: reading model output as certainty. Fix: include one failure mode and one robustness check.
- Mistake: skipping assumptions. Fix: list assumptions before interpretation.

## Revision Sprint
- Re-solve one earlier problem from memory before checking notes.
- Review yesterday's weak point and state whether it is fixed.
- Schedule the next spaced repetition date before ending the session.

## Real-World Data Lab
- Use yfinance first for SPY, QQQ, TLT, and GLD when internet is available.
- If available, validate against a Robinhood-style export CSV for consistency checks.
- Fall back to curriculum/datasets/real_market_prices.csv for reproducible runs.
- Design one topic-specific analysis for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure instead of reusing generic volatility-only metrics.
- Document one implementation risk and one robustness check before finalizing conclusions.

## Coding Task
Construct a lag-based pipeline for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure and compare one forecast baseline to one improved variant.
- Add comments that explain the intent of each major transformation and why it matters for quant decisions.
- Print one table and one metric summary that could be shown in a desk review.
- Add one stress or sensitivity variation and compare baseline versus stressed output.
- End with a one-paragraph interpretation describing actionability and limitations.

## Interview Drill
- Q1: Explain autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure to a non-technical stakeholder in 3 sentences.
- Q2: Give one failure case where this concept can produce misleading confidence.
- Q3: Show one concrete link from this concept to trading, portfolio construction, risk, or research quality.

## Reflection Prompt
What from autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and lag structure is now evidence-backed in your notes, and what still needs a focused retry?

## Completion Checklist
- I can explain the concept from memory without reading notes.
- I completed at least one coding exercise tied to the day topic.
- I wrote one realistic use case in my own words.
- I recorded at least one weak area in my error log.
- I set the next review date using spaced repetition.
